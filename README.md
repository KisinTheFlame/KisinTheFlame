### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Kisin, a student from Beihang University, or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(BUAA). Greatly enthusiastic for programming, I am currently striving for being admitted to Department of Computer Science and afterwards a job relevant to Java backend development, which is particularly attractive to me.

In October 2020, I accomplished my blog, using Vue.js and Spring boot&reg; instead of a blog framework such as Hexo and WordPress and so on. It is a educational and thrilling experience which cost me two months. I am delighted to find my efforts get generously paid.

Since I entered the world of coding in a memorable afternoon when I opened a book in C language programming in the city library, I have been immersing myself in coding for years. I hope I would fulfill my dream of creating splendid softwares which can bring convenience to other people.
